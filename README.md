# The Ray Tracer Challenge in F#
This repository is an F# implementation of the ray tracer found in [*The Ray Tracer Challenge: A Test-Driven Guide to Your First 3D Renderer*](https://pragprog.com/titles/jbtracer/the-ray-tracer-challenge/) by Jamis Buck. The [tests](https://github.com/bmitc/the-ray-tracer-challenge-fsharp/tree/main/RayTracerChallenge/XUnitTests) described in the book and more are fully implemented, and due to F#'s clean syntax and domain modeling, the tests are nearly identical at moments to the psuedocode used to specify the tests in the book. It has been a pleasure and a lot of fun to write this code in F#.

The book is written from an agnostic point of view regarding programming languages, although the suggested tests and implementations do lean towards mutability and OOP type of languages. This implementation has been made to be as idiomatic to F# as possible, making full use of F#'s functional-first but multiparadigm nature. Functional programming is mixed with OOP naturally, although immutability is still highly preferred.

## A note on implementation

Domain-driven design is heavily used in this implementation, where F# types of discriminated unions, records, and sometimes classes are used to model all of the various components of the ray tracer. Probably the largest departure from the book, and an excellent example of functional programming, is defining 3D transformations using a discriminated union:

```fsharp
/// Represents a 3D transform
type Transform =
    | Translation of x: float * y: float * z: float
    | Scaling     of x: float * y: float * z: float
    | Reflection  of Axis
    | Rotation    of Axis * angle: float<radians>
    | Shearing    of ShearComponent * proportion: float
    | Combination of Transform list // transforms will be listed left to right but applied right to left
```

The book does this differently and thus requires the computation of matrix inverses to compute inverses of these transformations. However, this is actually an example where the functional approach improves performance because creating inverses is as simple as pattern matching on the transformations:

```fsharp
/// Invert the transform
let rec inverse transform =
    match transform with
    | Translation (x, y, z)  -> Translation (-x, -y, -z)
    | Scaling (x, y, z)      -> Scaling (reciprocal x, reciprocal y, reciprocal z)
    | Reflection axis        -> Reflection axis
    | Rotation (axis, r)     -> Rotation (axis, -r)
    | Shearing (c, p)        -> Shearing (c, -p)
    | Combination transforms -> Combination (transforms |> List.rev |> List.map (fun t -> inverse t))
```
Note that the definition of the inverse of each transform essentially follows and highlights the intuitive notion of the inverse of a transformation.

The matrix representing any given transform can be directly returned by again pattern matching on the transformations. An abbreviated implementation is:

```fsharp
/// Get the matrix that represents the transform
let rec getTransformMatrix transform =
    match transform with
    | Translation (x,y,z) -> Matrix(4, 4, array2D [[1.0; 0.0; 0.0;  x ];
                                                   [0.0; 1.0; 0.0;  y ];
                                                   [0.0; 0.0; 1.0;  z ];
                                                   [0.0; 0.0; 0.0; 1.0]])
    | Scaling (x,y,z)     -> Matrix(4, 4, array2D [[ x ; 0.0; 0.0; 0.0];
                                                   [0.0;  y ; 0.0; 0.0];
                                                   [0.0; 0.0;  z ; 0.0];
                                                   [0.0; 0.0; 0.0; 1.0]])
    // and so on ...
```

Lastly, one of the tests exhibits the nicety of this approach, in that transforms can simply be strung together in pipe operations:

```fsharp
[<Fact>]
let ``Individual transformations are applied in sequence`` () =
    let p = point(1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
    
    p
    |> rotate (X, pi/2.0)
    |> scale (5.0, 5.0, 5.0)
    |> translate (10.0, 5.0, 7.0)
    |> should equal (point(15.0, 0.0, 7.0))
```
Each one of the transformation functions simply creates a transformation of the same name and applies it to the point by computing the matrix product of the transform's matrix and the point.
