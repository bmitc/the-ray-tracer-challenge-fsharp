(* Note: This is an interesting design challenge, designing the Canvas class and its constructors
         so as to communicate that a canvas represents a 2D grid of pixels. There are three main
         choices: (1) Force the construction of a canvas to use either int<pixels> or float<pixels>,
         converting non-pixels units int and float numbers to pixels units, (2) Allow int or float
         constructor arguments that have no units of measure (there is no way, even using generic
         units in the new type signature to allow generic units of measure which are then thrown
         away), or (3) Define a generic constructor units type variable as a type argument to the
         class itself, which then allows the constructors to take int, float, int<arbitrary>, or
         float<arbitrary> arguments.

         Option (3) was chosen because it allows the most flexibility and least amount of boilerplate.
         For example, tests can simply use Canvas(100, 200) to construct, while scripts might want
         to use Canvas(100<pixels>, 200<pixels>) to make the units of the canvas clear or even be
         derived from other defined bindings.

    /// Internal 1D array for the canvas.
    /// A 1D array is used instead of a 2D array, which was the original implementation, to get
    /// access to better higher-order functions in the Array module and to take advantage of
    /// the parallelized functions in the Array.Parallel module.

    (* Note on canvas positions:
       If we place an (x,y) coordinate value at every position in a 2x3 canvas' array, we have
       [[(0,0); (1,0); (2,0)]
        [(0,1); (1,1); (2,1)]]
       So x determines the column index and y determines the row index. Note also that the coordinate
       origin is at the top-left of the array and that x and y increase as we move to the right and
       down, respectively.
