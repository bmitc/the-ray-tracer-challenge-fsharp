    /// Internal 1D array for the canvas.
    /// A 1D array is used instead of a 2D array, which was the original implementation, to get
    /// access to better higher-order functions in the Array module and to take advantage of
    /// the parallelized functions in the Array.Parallel module.

    (* Note on canvas positions:
       If we place an (x,y) coordinate value at every position in a 2x3 canvas' array, we have
       [[(0,0); (1,0); (2,0)]
        [(0,1); (1,1); (2,1)]]
       So x determines the column index and y determines the row index. Note also that the coordinate
       origin is at the top-left of the array and that x and y increase as we move to the right and
       down, respectively.
