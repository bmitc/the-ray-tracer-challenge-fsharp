// Tuples are intentionally separated out into separate types of Vector and Point.
// This is because they are distinctilly two different types with enough variation
// that they don't belong as a single type. The ITuple interface provides shared
// behavior, that primarily allows Vector and Point to be transformed with matrices.
// There is a small hit in duplicated code, but this duplication is small and contained
// whereas the correct type design pays off in the overall design of the ray tracer.
